        <h3>Description :</h3>
        <p>The original Hershey's chocolate cake, which was made with six candy bars, was developed post-World War II.
                Americans loved the recipe because it celebrated the end of food shortages and, thus, the end of the war
                years. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients :</h3>
        <ul>
                <li><strong>Sugar :</strong> Two cups of white sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness, while locking
                        in the moisture from
                        the other ingredients.

                <li><strong>Flour</strong> : All-purpose flour provides structure, acts as a thickening agent, and helps
                        build the fluffy
                        texture.

                <li><strong>Cocoa Powder </strong>: Of course, you'll want to use Hershey's brand unsweetened cocoa
                        powder for this one. It
                        adds the rich, indulgent flavor you know and love.

                <li><strong>Leaveners</strong> : Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners, which means they cause
                        the batter to expand
                        and give the cake a perfect rise.

                <li><strong>Salt</strong> : Just a teaspoon of salt is all you'll need to add complexity and highlight
                        the other flavors. It
                        might not seem like a lot, but you'll definitely miss the salt if you skip it.

                <li><strong>Eggs</strong> : Whole eggs affect the cake in a number of ways: They provide structure, add
                        moisture, lend
                        flavor, and contribute to a tender texture.

                <li><strong>Milk</strong> : Whole milk adds moisture and helps the batter come together smoothly.

                <li><strong>Oil</strong> : Vegetable oil ensures your cake will never be dry.

                <li><strong>Vanilla</strong> : Two teaspoons of vanilla extract add complex flavor and bring out the
                        flavors of the other
                        ingredients, such as the cocoa powder.

                <li><strong>Boiling Water</strong> : You might be wondering why this recipe calls for a cup of boiling
                        water. It intensifies
                        the chocolatey flavor, contributes to the fluffy texture, and reacts with the leaveners to
                        create an
                        even higher rise.
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps :</h3>
        <ol>
                <li>Make the Batter - Stir together the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add the wet ingredients and beat with an electric mixer for about three minutes. Stir in the boiling water by hand.</li>
                <li>Bake the Cake - Pour the batter into two prepared round cake pans. Bake in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool slightly before removing from the pans.</li>
                <li>Frost the Cake - While the cake finishes cooling to room temperature, make the frosting: Cream the butter, stir in the cocoa and confectioners' sugar alternately with the milk and vanilla, and beat until it's smooth and spreadable.</li>
                <li>When the cake is completely cooled, top each layer with the frosting. Stack them and continue frosting until the cake is completely covered.</li>
        </ol>
